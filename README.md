This web tracking application empowers users to discover new workouts, stay motivated, and monitor their fitness journey over time. 
The user interface is intentionally simple to keep the experience engaging and accessible.
During development, I strengthened my skills in HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, and cloud computing platforms.
A key highlight of the project is the custom business logic behind the progress tracker.
It dynamically responds to logged workouts and updates user stats in real time, offering personalized feedback that encourages consistency and growth
